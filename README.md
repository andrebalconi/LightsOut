# LightsOut

# About Project

A Lights-Out board consists of a grid of light bulbs, some of which are initially on. Clicking on a light bulb will toggle the state of the clicked light bulb, as well as the state of all adjacent light bulbs (von Neumann neighborhood) to it. The object of the game is to turn off all the light bulbs.
